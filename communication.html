                <h4 class="intro">INTRODUCTION</h4>
                <p>

                  Working as a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) gives me a unique perspective and set of skills.
                  What is essential in the healthcare industry is also valuable in the tech community.
                  Below are some indispensable lessons I've learned in my current job that will serve me well in my next one.
                </p>
                <h4>FAILURES ARE OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
                <p>
                  Skilled nursing facilities can sometimes feel like the House of Chaos, and if everything goes right in one day, it means I'm going to find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow on the way home from work.
                  Since that's never happened, I've learned something important: It's ok for everything to not be perfect.
                  Or for things to not go as planned. Or to hear someone tell you "no." Or to be wrong!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've learned to use the Art of Wrong to my advantage: If something doesn't go as planned, I take a step back and think, "Ok, why didn't this work, and what can I do differently next time?"
                  Using failures as opportunities to learn has helped me become a better therapist, and it has similarly improved my coding and web design skills.
                  Because there's nothing like spending days trying to figure out why something doesn't work, only to find the issue on one little line of code, which will be burned in my memory for eternity.
                </p>
                <h4>NO ONE IS AN ISLAND</h4>
                <p>
                  A single patient has an entire team of professionals working on her case:
                  Therapists, doctors, nurses and nurse's aides, social workers and dietitians, and even the maintenance person who is literally the only one in the building who can fix the remote.
                  As an SLP, working well with others not only makes my day go smoother, but it also leads to better patient outcomes.
                  Every person on a team has something valuable to contribute.
                  I expect that teamwork will be an essential part of my new career in order to produce top-notch work.
                </p>
                <h4>WHAT WORKS FOR ONE MIGHT NOT WORK FOR ANOTHER</h4>
                  <p>
                    Because people are different, therapy approaches have to be tailored to the individual.
                    During my work day, I carry around a lot materials (and have the sore arms to prove it).
                    But I do it because I learned early on that the type of approach in therapy can be as important as the therapy itself:
                    Trying to use photos with a blind patient or expecting my patient with arthritic hands to write down something will not lead to success.
                    So, I have to get creative and use my patient's needs and interests as a guide to choosing the right therapy tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I liken my therapy materials to my web design tools -- using the framework Bootstrap, for example, might work for one project, but not for another.
                    So, I choose to be flexible and find value in questioning the status quo.
                    It leads to more successful therapy (and in my portfolio, better quality work).
                  </p>
                <h4>WE SURE ARE DIFFERENT, BUT WE'RE THE SAME, TOO</h4>
                  <p>
                    Regardless of a patient's medical condition, age, gender, race, or past life experience, there is something that we all have in common:
                    Everyone wants to be respected, and everyone wants to be heard.
                    I know it seems like a platitude from kindergarten, but unfortunately this golden rule is not always upheld in healthcare.
                    I've seen dismissive attitudes from nurses's aids all the way up to doctors, and it can do a lot of damage to someone who is already in pain.
                    When patients feel like they are important and worthy of consideration, it has a positive effect on everything else --
                    their willingness to participate in therapy, their motivation to try harder, and their ability to achieve their goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is a crucial lesson that I will take with me to my new job, because everything is better when there is respect among the people you work with.
