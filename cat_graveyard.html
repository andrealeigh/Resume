                <p>
                  This is a personal website dedicated to things my cats have destroyed, or to put it more dramatically:
                  <i>To mourn the CATastrophes commited by two little monsters, Felix and Feynman the Cats.</i>
                  Completed September 2014.

                <h4>INSPIRATION</h4>
                <p>
                  Once upon a time, I looked around my apartment and realized, wow.
                  My cats are special.
                  <img src="images/feynman.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" alt="Feynman"/>
                  So I started taking pictures of some fantastically disfigured household objects, courtesy of my little brats. Initially, these photos were only sent to family and friends who responded
                  LOL OMG WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR CATS AT LEAST TODDLERS TURN INTO ADULTS EVENTUALLY (love you guys too). At some point
                  I started iterating on the idea of a creepy hilarious graveyard filled with destroyed inaminate objects.
                  Because when you can't have anything nice, it's better to make a website about it than to cry yourself to sleep.
                </p>
                <h4>ARTWORK AND CONTENT</h4>
                <p>
                  All of the images are original artwork I created via Adobe Illustrator CC. I drew inspiration from old expansive graveyards photographed in twilight,
                  intricate marble details faded with time, and the curious symbol of a skull with angel wings carved on headstones all around Boston.
                  I had a wonderful time listening to scary music and pouring over images of old gravestones late into the night, to the point where my husband
                  started giving me the side-eye while gently asking, "Is everything OK? Should I be worried?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also had a blast creating the obituary-like poems for each object. (Fortunately, I did most of the laughing to/at myself in the comfort of my own home instead of in a coffee shop.)
                  I have a background in linguistics and journalism, and creative writing is something that has always been near and dear to my heart.
                  This project became a unique creative outlet and reminded me of how much I loved writing.
                </p>
                <h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  I developed the website using Bootstrap and SCSS. This was the first time making my CSS code "Sassy," and by the end I was sold on its benefits and power.
                  This was also the first project that I deliberately tried to make look less like a "typical" Bootstrap website.
                  Taking this approach created a motivating challenge and ultimately helped me improve my coding skills.
                  The end result is that I was able to produce something closer to my visual goals, but the downside was that I lost some of the automatic responsive features of Bootstrap. So, my website looks pretty good on my 13-inch laptop,
                  but not so great on a mobile device or big fancy iMac with Retina 5K display.

                </p>
                <h4>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  As more time passes, the more critical I become of the end product. I'm not sold on the font I used for "Here leith" and "Taketh" in the first blurb after the top image.
                  And speaking of that top image, why didn't I save it as SVG? At larger screens the image stops expanding. Sad.
                  I also need to add some sort of marker that communicates: <i>Hey user! Scroll down. Click on those gravestones.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while I initially loved the incredibly large spacing between the gravestones, I now go back and forth on whether it really works.
                  Every time I look at my website, my internal muttering sounds something like this: <i> Hey girl, that spacing definitely looks strange and unecessary on larger-then-13-inch screens.
                  But it helps the user focus on one gravestone at a time! There is something I want to articulate about a minimalist website! I want candy! </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At some point, I would like to revist this project and address these issues. And while it is easy for me to tear it apart and poke at its flaws, I am also extremely proud of the creativity generated from something as mundane as broken cheap plastic blinds.
