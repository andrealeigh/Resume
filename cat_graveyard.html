                <p>
                  This is a personal website dedicated to things my cats have destroyed, or to put it more dramatically:
                  To mourn the CATastrophes commited by two little monsters, Felix and Feynman the Cats.
                  Completed September 2014.

                  Once upon a time, I looked around my apartment and realized, wow.
                  My cats are special. (They say they're "artistic.")
                  So I started taking pictures of some, er, fantastically disfigured household items, I mean artwork. I sent the photos to family and friends who unaminously responded with:
                </p>
                <p>
                  LOL OMG WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR CATS AT LEAST TODDLERS TURN INTO ADULTS EVENTUALLY... AHHHH
                </p>
                <p>
                  At some point I started iterating on the idea of a creepy hilarious graveyard filled with destroyed inaminate objects.
                  Because when you can't have anything nice, it's better to make a website about it than to cry yourself to sleep.
                </p>
                <h4>ARTWORK AND CONTENT</h4>
                <p>
                  All of the images are original artwork I created via Adobe Illustrator CC. I drew inspiration from a variety of sources: Old expansive graveyards photographed in twilight,
                  intricate marble details accentuated with city dirt and grit, and the curious symbol of a skull with angel wings carved on headstones all around Boston.
                  I had a wonderful time listening to scary music and pouring over images of old gravestones late into the night, to the point where my husband
                  started giving me the side-eye while gently asking, "Is everything OK? Should I be worried?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also had a blast creating the obituary-like poems for each object.
                  I have a background in linguistics and journalism, and creative writing is something that has always been near and dear to my heart.
                  This project became a unique creative outlet and reminded me that I still love to write.
                </p>
                <h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  I developed the website using Bootstrap and SCSS. This was the first time making my CSS code "Sassy," and by the end I was sold on its benefits and power.
                  This was also the first project that I deliberately tried to make look less like a typical Bootstrap website.
                  This was a motivating challenge and ultimately helped me improve my coding skills.
                  The end result is that I was able to produce something closer to my visual goals, but the downside was that I lost some of the responsive features of Bootstrap. So, my website looks pretty good on my 13-inch laptop,
                  but not so great on a mobile device or a big fancy iMac with Retina 5K display.

                </p>
                <h4>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  As more time passes, the more critical I become of the end product. I'm not sold on the font I used for certain words in the blurb after the top image.
                  And speaking of that top image, why didn't I save it as SVG? At larger screens the image stops expanding. Sad.
                  My call to actions need to be more obvious, and they need to communicate: <span class="italic">Hey user! Scroll down. Click on those gravestones.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while I initially loved the incredibly large spacing between the gravestones, I now go back and forth on whether it really works.
                  Every time I look at my website, my internal muttering sounds something like this: <span class="italic"> Hey girl, that spacing definitely looks strange and unecessary on larger-then-13-inch screens.
                  But it helps the user focus on one gravestone at a time! And when the user clicks on a gravestone, a modal opens to the left or right of it! Minimalist websites can be cool! I want candy! </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At some point, I would like to revist this project and continue to improve the website.
                  While it is easy for me to tear it apart and poke at its flaws, I am also pretty proud of the amount of creativity generated from something as mundane as cheap broken plastic blinds.
