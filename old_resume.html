                <p>
                  This was the first version of my personal website intended to be used as a resume.
                  It was a project of many firsts: My first attempt at developing a website, making artwork in Adobe Illustrator, learning how to use Bootstrap, and applying UX/UI and responsive web design concepts.
                  Completed July 2014.

                  <img src="images/rabbit_hole.jpg" class="img-inspiration img-responsive pull-right" alt="Rabbit hole"/>
                  About a year ago, I fell down the rabbit hole of discovering HTML and CSS.
                  I started perusing online tutorials by Code Academy, Code School, Khan Academy, etc.
                  The more I learned, the more I wanted to know, and eventually my internal whispering started to sound something like this: <span class="italic"> Hey girl, this is kind of fun. Don't people make careers out of this stuff?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wanted to make a website where I could showcase my personal projects and chronicle skills I was starting to acquire.

                </p>
                <h4>ARTWORK AND CONTENT</h4>
                <p>
                  The top image of the website was created in Adobe Illustrator CC.
                  Although the final piece didn't turn out the way I had envisioned (<a href="https://twitter.com/msteciuk">someone</a> once told me everything you initially make is crap), it did become the visual foundation for the website redesign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As touched on earlier, the content consists of my personal portfolio, acquired web design skills, work experience, and education.
                </p>
                <h4>UX/UI</h4>
                <p>
                  After reading Steve Krug's fantastic <span class="italic">Don't Make Me Think (Revisited)</span>, I set out to make a website that would make Mr. Krug sing. And maybe tap dance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a user initially visited my website, my number one goal was to clearly communicate the purpose of the website and its contents. I wanted it to say: <span class="italic">Hey User! This is a website about me.</span>
                  I achieved this by making my name and occupation front and center and using plain english to describe the website's sections in the navbar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, I had to decide which path I wanted the user to take to access the sections: Scroll down, or click?
                  After doing some research, I decided that scrolling trumped clicking for a couple of reasons: The content I wanted to display was relatively minimal compared to, let's say, the New York Times, and I had read in multiple places that <a href="http://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll">users like to scroll</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more I worked on the website, the more I appreciated this process of decision-making. Here are a few more things I implemented to help my users:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Ordering the sections on the navbar:</span> They corresponded with the order in which the categories were organized on the website, and they were also ordered based on importance from top to bottom.
                      I determined importance by looking at the personal websites of web designers that I admired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Changing the color of navbar categories as the user scrolled:</span> I thought this was a nice way to reinforce where the user was on the website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Visually organizing my portfolio section:</span> How to effectively showcase my personal projects was a tricky question to answer.
                      I had seen portfolio pieces displayed a few different ways on the websites of other web designers, and I focused on making a decision between two main ideas:
                      <img src="images/graph_paper.jpg" class="img-description img-responsive" alt="Graph_paper"/>
                      I knew the research said users like to scroll, but I personally was drawn to portfolios that gave me a bird's-eye view of all of the work a designer included on her website.
                      I liked the idea of giving the user a choice to click on what looked interesting rather than require that every piece be scrolled through in order to get a feel for the entire portfolio.
                      I also knew that a visual way to organize information was already popular and familiar with a wide audience (hey, Pinterest!).
                      In the end, I decided to go with Idea #2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Elements that react to user behavior in a subtle way:</span> I noticed that when I visit websites, one of my initial behaviors is to hover my mouse over words, icons, and images to see if they're clickable.
                      I indicated clickable items on my website by changing the color of the links. I also extended this to table rows containing work and education information. When a user hovered over the row, the row changed color.
                      Reading a CV can be a little dull, so I thought this would be a nice way to jazz up a user's experience without distracting from the content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Allowing the main information to breathe:</span> I had a lot to say about my employment experience, but I didn't want to overwhelm the user, either.
                      So, I took the details about my responsibilities working as a Speech-Language Pathologist and put it into a modal.
                      That way, if someone was interested in what I did as an SLP, they could read it without the main information getting lost in a sea of details.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Working through these questions and challenges was an eye-opening process that influenced the way I think about user experience.
                  Before making my first website, I had no idea what user experience was or why it was important.
                  I now appreciate how even the smallest of details can shape how engaging or intuitive a website is to use.

                <h4>RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  I developed this website using Bootstrap 3, which I chose to learn for a couple of reasons:
                  I wanted to start investing my time and skills practicing responsive web design,
                  but I needed a framework that was beginner-friendly. Bootstrap had an endless amount of how-to articles and youtube videos compared to Foundation, which I was also considering at the time.
                  The large Bootstrap community was indispensable and ultimately helped me bootstrap (sorry) my knowledge and skills about responsive web design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's what I learned about Bootstrap's mobile-first responsive features and responsive web design:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span class="blue">Responsive grid system:</span>
                      The grid is 12 columns across and is based on media queries that scale the columns based on a user's browser screen size.
                      My website's content sections were in panels 10 columns across and offset by 1 column, which centered the panels on all screen sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <span class="blue">Fixed- vs. fluid-width:</span>
                    Bootstrap also allows you to choose between a fixed- vs. fluid-width container.
                    For this project, I chose to use fixed-width for all of my content in order to keep my panels from expanding to 100% of the viewport width. This helped me maintain <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/29/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/">readability</a>: I maintained white space and kept the characters at a comfortable line length.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     <span class="blue">Media queries:</span>
                     Bootstrap comes with four categories relating to viewport pixel size that serve as breakpoints for their responsive grid.
                     This is helpful because rules that work for mobile-sized screens may need to be modified for larger screens.
                     For example, my portfolio section contains six image thumbnails that needed to be organized differently according to the user's screen size.
                     To address this, I used Bootstrap's predefined grid classes:
                     <img src="images/code_screenshot.png" class="img-description img-responsive" alt="Screenshot"/>
                     Basically, I specified a rule that said: At medium-size screens and larger, position the thumbnails to span across four columns each (i.e., col-md-4);
                     from extra-small screen sizes to small screen sizes, position the thumbnails to span across six columns each (i.e., col-xs-6). This way, there are three thumbnails per row on medium-size screens and larger, and two per row on extra-small and small screen sizes.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     <span class="blue">Responsive images:</span>
                     It was very easy to make images responsive based on a user's viewport width by assigning an image-responsive class to the images.
                     Although my top image did not span the full width of the screen size, it scaled to the maximum width of its parent element.
                   </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned so much about responsive web design as I practiced using Bootstrap.
                  We are living in a time where users are accessing information on the web through a variety of ways that are continuing to evolve -- different screen sizes, resolutions, and bandwidths; use of touchscreens vs. keyboards; use of <a href="http://www.prentrom.com/what-is-augmentative-and-alternative-communication">computer-based alternative augmentative communication</a> methods.
                  It is exciting to be learning about web design in an era where the tools used to create websites are adapting to new technology and user needs.
                </p>
                <h4>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
                <p>
                  A few months ago, I looked at my website and cringed. Sure, it got the job done and worked well on my phone.
                  But visually it looked dated and boring. The top image was bad. The typography was bad. The whole website looked too "Bootstrapy."
                  In October, I started working on the redesign. Read more about that <a href="current_resume.html">here</a>.
